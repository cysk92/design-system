# Form field templates

Form fields can be organized in two different ways: stacked and inlined.

In a stacked layout, the label is placed above the input field, creating a vertical alignment.
In contrast, an inlined layout places the label and input field on the same row, creating a horizontal alignment.

This allows for flexibility in designing forms to suit different user interface requirements.

## Stacked form fields

<Canvas of={FormStories.StackedFormField} sourceState="shown" />
<Canvas of={FormStories.StackedFormFieldWithHint} sourceState="shown" />
<Canvas of={FormStories.StackedFormFieldWithNote} sourceState="shown" />
<Canvas of={FormStories.StackedFormFieldWithError} sourceState="shown" />

## Inlined form fields

<Canvas of={FormStories.InlinedFormField} sourceState="shown" />
<Canvas of={FormStories.InlinedFormFieldWithHint} sourceState="shown" />
<Canvas of={FormStories.InlinedFormFieldWithNote} sourceState="shown" />
<Canvas of={FormStories.InlinedFormFieldWithError} sourceState="shown" />
