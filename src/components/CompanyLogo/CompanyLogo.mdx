# CompanyLogo

<Subtitle>
  A versatile container designed for the consistent display of company logos. It
  ensures that logos are presented in an uniform manner across different parts
  of an application.
</Subtitle>

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `CompanyLogo` component is to provide a standardized way to display company logos, handling various states such as loading, error, and success. It ensures that logos are displayed with the correct aspect ratio, size, and styling, maintaining a cohesive look and feel.

## Usage

To use the `CompanyLogo` component, simply import it:

```js
import { CompanyLogo } from '@security-scorecard/design-system';
```

Then provide the required props `src` for the logo URL, `alt` for alternative text.

Example:

<Canvas layout="centered" of={CompanyLogoStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

<ArgTypes />

## Sizes

The `CompanyLogo` component supports the following 4 sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.

<Canvas layout="centered" of={CompanyLogoStories.Sizes} />

## Error Handling

The `CompanyLogo` component has built-in error handling. If the logo fails to load, the component will display a fallback icon. An optional prop `shouldHideOnLoadError` can be used to control the behavior when the logo fails to load. If this prop is set to `true`, the component will not display the logo and will display the fallback icon instead.

### Fallback example

<img
  alt="Company Logo Error"
  height={56}
  src="./images/company-logo-error.png"
  width={56}
/>

## Loading

The `CompanyLogo` component has built-in loading state. If the logo is still loading, the component will display a spinner.

### Loading example

<img
  alt="Company Logo Error"
  height={56}
  src="./images/company-logo-loading.png"
  width={56}
/>
